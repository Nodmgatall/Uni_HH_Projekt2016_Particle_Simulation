    Variable names:
        lower case
        words sepreated by _
        Member variables:
            variable name has a m_ before the name 
                eg: m_member_variable_x
        Global variables:
            all Upper case
            variable nam has a G_ before the name
                eg: G_DEBUG_FILE_STRING

    Macros (please no :P)
        All Upper case
        variable name has a M_ before the macro name

    parameter names:
        nothing special just a name in lower case
        fitting names
        short forms only if REALLY necessary (almost never)
        p_ before parameters

    Mehthod names
        lower case
        words sepreated by _
    Class names
        first character Uppercase
            rest lower
        CamelCase

    Enumerations:
    	enum name lower case
        enum name has a e_ at the beginning
        enum e_list_of_whatever{EINS, ZWEI, DREI, ETC}

    Structs that define a type:
	    lower case
        struct name has a s_ at the beginning
        eg: s_data_collection

    use of auto:
        i kind of dislike the use of auto since it obscures code
        in range based for loops the use of auto is ok as long as the variable name is well chosen.

    the ?: Opertator
        nice to use, bad to read

    
    id like not to use typedefs as the variable name should make clear what it is so there is no need
    to let the type clarify what it is

    we also need to talk about if we care where variables are defined
    for example if we want to define every variable in a function at the top or if we dont give a damn and declare/define them when we need them (no real opinion on that)
